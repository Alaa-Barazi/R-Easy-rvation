# R-Easy-rvation

<br/>
Been working on this project for the past year at ORT BRAUDE COLLEGE and its called R'Easy'rvation...
<br/>
an online destination for globetrotting gastronomes. This website reimagines the restaurant reservation experience,<br/>
allowing customers to explore dining options from around the world in an entirely unique way. R'Easy'rvation offers a thrilling twist: 
<br/>
like each booking webiste customers can randomly pick tables within the restaurants that they choose but for those with a more discerning palate,

an advanced option provides a captivating visualization of each restaurant's layout, enabling customers to handpick their preferred table down to the seat.
<br/>
R'Easy'rvation offers a dual registration system designed for two distinct user types. <br/>
Customers can revel in a user-friendly interface, enabling them to place orders, report their restaurant experiences, leave reviews, and easily access their order history.

<br/>
Meanwhile, restaurant owners have their own portal, allowing them to showcase their culinary treasures. <br/>
However, inclusion on the platform requires approval from the admin, ensuring that only the finest establishments make the cut. <br/>
Restaurant owners receive email notifications once their venue is approved, granting them access to a comprehensive dashboard. <br/>
This dashboard empowers them to review performance reports, customize their restaurant's ambiance and layout, curate menus, and engage with customer reviews.
<br/>
The admin, holding the reins of the entire R'Easy'rvation platform, oversees various critical functions. <br/>
They manage the financial aspect, taking a modest 20% commission from each order while also curating the platform by approving and, if necessary, removing restaurants to maintain quality standards.
<br/>
R'Easy'rvation is different from other websites, it creates an easier environment for food enthusiasts and restaurateurs, saves time and provides a more simple way of handling reservations for restaurant Owners!
